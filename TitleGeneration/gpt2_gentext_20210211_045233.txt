I remember that night I remember that–
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame every part aflame
This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean you forget yourself
Youre like me Im never satisfied
Is that right
Ive never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your family from
Unimportant theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch
Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes everything we said in total agreement
Its a dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt but Ima give it a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer
His hands started fidgeting he looked askance
Hes penniless hes flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome boy does he know it
Peach fuzz and he cant even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sisters face and she is...

I remember that night I remember that–
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame every part aflame
This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean you forget yourself
Youre like me Im never satisfied
Is that right
Ive never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your family from
Unimportant theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch
Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes everything we said in total agreement
Its a dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt but Ima give it a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer
His hands started fidgeting he looked askance

I remember that night I remember that–
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame every part aflame
This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean you forget yourself
Youre like me Im never satisfied
Is that right
Ive never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your family from
Unimportant theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch
Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes everything we said in total agreement
Its a dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt but Ima give it a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer
His hands started fidgeting he looked askance
Hes penniless hes flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome boy does he know it
Peach fuzz and he cant even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place

I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame every part aflame
This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean you forget yourself
Youre like me Im never satisfied
Is that right
Ive never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your family from
Unimportant theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch
Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes everything we said in total agreement
Its a dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt but Ima give it a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer
His hands started fidgeting he looked askance
Hes penniless hes flying by the seat of his pants
