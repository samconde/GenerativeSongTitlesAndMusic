Angelica Schuyler

A toast to the groom 
To the groom

Angelica

to the revolution
And the hope that 
you provide 
You provide you provide

Rewind
Rewind 
rewind
Helpless skys skys
Drownin in em
Drownin rewind
I remember that night I just might 
Rewind
I remember that night I just might 
Rewind
I remember that night I remember that–
I remember that night I just might regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream that you cant quite place
But Alexander Ill never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said "Hi" I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame every part aflame
This is not a game
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
Im sure I dont know what you mean you forget yourself
Youre like me Im never satisfied
Is that right
Ive never been satisfied
My name is Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Wheres your family from
Unimportant theres a million things I havent done
But just you wait just you wait
So so so
So this is what it feels like to match wits with someone at your level
What the hell is the catch
Its the feeling of freedom of seein the light
Its Ben Franklin with a key and a kite
You see it right
The conversation lasted two minutes
Maybe three minutes everything we said in total agreement
Its a dream and its a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture its a bit of a stance
Hes a bit of a flirt but Ima give it a chance
I asked about his family did you see his answer
His hands started fidgeting he looked askance
Hes penniless hes flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome boy does he know it
Peach fuzz and he cant even grow it
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sisters face and she is...
Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time
Where are you taking me
Im about to change your life
Then by all means lead the way
Number one
Im a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so Im the one who has to social climb for one
So Im the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesnt mean I want him any less
Elizabeth Schuyler its a pleasure to meet you
Schuyler
My sister
Number two
Hes after me cause Im a Schuyler sister that elevates his status
Id have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza now thats his bride
Nice going Angelica he was right you will never be satisfied
Thank you for all your service
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet it will have been worth it
Ill leave you to it
Number three
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him shed be silently resigned hed be mine
She would say "Im fine"
Shed be lying
But when I fantasize at night its Alexanders eyes
As I romanticize what might have been if I hadnt sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Elizas his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life
To the groom
